    "The main idea for almost all neural networks are its layers. Each layer would have a certain amount of \"neurons\" or \"nodes\", which would each hold a weight value. By assigning different weights to each neuron in the layers, the input signals will get amplified or diminished in its corresponding areas.\n",
