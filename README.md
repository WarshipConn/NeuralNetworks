# Neural Network Fundamentals with Computer Vision
By David Gao

This is a repository containing a collection of my various projects regarding Neural Networks and Computer Vision, as well as an research documentation that details all of my learnings and takeaways in said subject.

Note: As of 10/4/2024, some programs assumes that you have cuda (aka a NVIDIA GPU) on your device. I'll make all the programs adaptable to most hardware once I clean up some code.
